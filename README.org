* News
  - Dump =vue-mode= to use =web-mode=. This layer creates a derived mode on the
    fly out of web-mode to handle vue file.
  - Wholesome features from =web-mode=, especially on template part
  - Better performance
  - If you need the old one use branch ~v1~

* Description
Layer for Vue, for working with  =.vue= files.

** Features:
- on-the-fly syntax checking with =eslint=
- proper syntax highlight and indentation with =vue-mode=
- two options for backend support for autocompletion and code analyis: =lsp= and =dumb= 
- code autocompletion with =company= layer
- formatting code with =prettier= layer
- =evil-matchit= =%= to jump between open and close tags
- =emmet-mode= and =yasnippet= for code expanding with =tab= key

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =vue= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

Vue layer uses the backend defined in variable =vue-backend=. Options are =dumb=
and =lsp=. Default is =dumb= backend. To choose a default backend set the layer
variable =vue-backend=:

#+begin_src elisp
(vue :variables vue-backend 'lsp)
#+end_src

To use the on-the-fly syntax checking, install =eslint=:

#+begin_src sh
  $ npm install -g eslint
#+end_src

Check eslint official doc for setting rules

To use automatic code formatting you need to install =prettier= with:

#+begin_src sh
  $ npm install -g prettier
#+end_src

If you want to use local =eslint= and =prettier= in your project, turn on node
  layer =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= function:

#+begin_src elisp
     (node :variable node-add-modules-path)
#+end_src

* Backends 
** dumb
dumb backend is light weight and fast. =dumb-jump= is used to handled go to
definition (=gd= vim keybinding). Because of the template nature of Vue, it
works very well. 

Company backend is set to be very eager in suggestions. 

=eslint= is used for linting.

** lsp
Vue language server needed to be installed 
   
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ npm install -g vue-language-server
#+END_SRC
   
This backend provides all the fancy features like: jump to definition,
references, type inference... However, =eslint= is explicitly selected for
linting because it works better than =lsp= linter.

* Optional Configuration
~web-mode-script-padding~ is set to 0, so indent is zero at root level inside
~script~ tag

Same as =react= layer, you may refer to the =web-mode= configuration for fine
tuning the indenting behaviour.

For example, if you wan't two space indentation, put this in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   ;; web-mode
   web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-css-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-code-indent-offset 2
   web-mode-attr-indent-offset 2)
#+end_src

* Key Bindings
** web-mode
  Free stuff from `html' layer, with minor change to avoid conflict with =lsp= layer
